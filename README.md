# Fake News Page - React.ts, Node.js, OpenAI API

This is a page that displays some articles from https://www.espn.com/ with generated title and image given from the OpenAI API
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to run this project

1. Clone this repositry to your machine
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the 'backend' directory: `cd backend`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm i`
4. Paste your OPENAI_API_KEY inside the .env file
5. Run: `node index.js`
6. Open a new terminal (in the root directory) and install the dependencies: `npm i`
7. Run the project: `npm run start`

### Notes

My OpenAI_API key exceeded the limit of the API calls so it does not work anymore, make sure to replace the API_KEY inside the .env file in the backend directory if you want to see the generated title and image.

I did not finish to work on the category of the article because my OpenAI API key stopped to work, if you will provide me a new key I would glad to work on it.

Besides that the work on OpenAI API was a real joy and exposed me to the many things that can be done with that API.
